/**
 * Closure P1.3 — verify a configured `APP_DB_ROLE` is actually usable before
 * `getTenantDb()` trusts it to enforce row-level security.
 *
 * `client.ts` computes `RLS_ROLE` from `process.env.APP_DB_ROLE` at module
 * load, but until this module it never checked whether an *invalid* value
 * (fails `isValidDbRole`) or an otherwise-valid role Postgres refuses to
 * grant (missing, or not assumable by the connection role) actually stops a
 * query from running. Both cases must refuse the query instead of silently
 * falling back to the connection's own — possibly BYPASSRLS — role.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any `@nebutra/*` or Prisma import: `client.ts` needs
 * the real generated Prisma client (`#prisma-client`, which resolves to a
 * build output — see its own note on why the singleton stays lazy) just to
 * import, so a test that imports `client.ts` directly needs the package
 * built first. This module takes the already-resolved role and a minimal
 * executor shape instead, so it — and the fail-closed behavior it adds — can
 * be unit tested against a fake client with no build step.
 *
 * `client.ts` still keeps its own copy of the `SET LOCAL ROLE` / set_config
 * statements (pinned by tests/architecture/tenant-cutover-contract.test.ts
 * until the P1.2 follow-up routes `getTenantDb` through
 * `@nebutra/tenant/isolation`'s tenant session core, which already closes
 * this same gap for `withRls` and `withTenantContext` — see
 * `resolveRlsRoleOrThrow` and `planTenantSession` in
 * `packages/iam/tenant/src/rls-session.ts`). This module only adds the
 * missing verification on top of that copy; it does not change what gets
 * sent to Postgres.
 *
 * `assertRlsRoleUsable` throws a plain `Error`, not `@nebutra/tenant`'s
 * `TenantIsolationError` — deliberately, for the same reason this file avoids
 * importing `@nebutra/tenant`: that class only exists in `@nebutra/tenant`'s
 * *built* `dist` output (its package exports resolve to `dist/*.js`), and
 * importing it here would reattach the build-step dependency this module is
 * written to avoid. A caller that specifically catches `TenantIsolationError`
 * (e.g. `withRls`/`withTenantContext`'s callers) will not catch this one even
 * though it is the same class of tenant-isolation failure; match on the error
 * message (`[db] APP_DB_ROLE`) instead, or catch `Error` generically.
