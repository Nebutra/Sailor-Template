 * Next-steps cheat sheet for create-sailor.

 * opens on): it reads the brand name and the capability readiness `pnpm dev`
 * hands it, so there is nothing to generate there. This writes the same
 * guidance as `.sailor/next-steps.md` for terminals, CI logs and editors.

## What you can do next

- See which capabilities are live and which keys they need: \`nebutra status\`
- Write your marketing site's words in \`apps/landing/src/content/site.ts\`
- Your account, workspace and sessions: \`/settings\` in the product app
- For China deployments, set \`NEBUTRA_LOCALE=cn\` and see \`packages/ops/china-compliance/README.md\`

Your AI-native SaaS scaffold is ready, and it runs without any keys, Docker or
database setup:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

That builds what the apps need, starts the product app (http://localhost:3001),
the site (http://localhost:3000) and the API gateway (http://localhost:3002),
and prints which capabilities are live and which still run a local fallback.
Open http://localhost:3001/welcome — sign up there, or sign in with the demo
account the local database seeds: admin@example.com / preview-demo.

Then:

1. **Make it yours** — \`brand.config.ts\` already carries the project's name
   (the logo is a text wordmark until you add files under
   \`brand.config/assets/logo/\`). Edit the name, colours or links, then apply
   it everywhere:
   \`\`\`bash
   pnpm brand:apply
   \`\`\`

2. **Take a capability live** — copy its key from \`.env.example\` into
   \`.env.local\` (random secrets are already generated there) and restart \`pnpm dev\`.

3. **Use your own Postgres (optional)** — the preview keeps its data in a local PGlite
   database (\`DATABASE_URL="pglite:"\`, data under \`.nebutra/pglite/\`). Point
   \`DATABASE_URL\` in \`.env.local\` at your Postgres, then apply the schema:
   \`\`\`bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed
   \`\`\`

The welcome page lives at \`apps/web/src/vite-app/routes/welcome.tsx\`; delete it
(and point \`routes/index.tsx\` elsewhere) once you have your own home page.
