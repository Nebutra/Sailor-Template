# Cost guardrails

What stops a runaway bill on PlanetScale and Upstash, what is enforced in this
repo, and what can only be set in a provider console.

None of it changes behaviour for normal traffic. Every limit here is set above
what real usage does; the point is to bound the failure, not to shape the
success.

## Where the money actually goes

Ranked by how much damage a single bad day can do:

| Risk | Ceiling | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI token spend | none today | **open — see below** |
| Vercel build minutes / on-demand | per-app ignore + Git auto-deploy flags | [vercel-spend.md](./vercel-spend.md) |
| Postgres storage growth | retention windows | `retention.sql` + Cron Trigger |
| Postgres runaway query CPU | 30s | role `statement_timeout` |
| Postgres connection exhaustion | 50 | role `CONNECTION LIMIT` |
| Redis command volume | plan cap | Upstash console budget |
| Redis memory | 3 GB | plan cap, enforced by provider |

The database guardrails bound tens-to-hundreds of dollars. An AI gateway with
no per-request ceiling can burn thousands in one night, and it is the one row
in that table with nothing in the third column.

## PlanetScale

### Enforced in this repo

`infra/data/database/policies/cost-guardrails.sql`, applied to `app_user` by
`scripts/provision-fresh-database.sh`. These are role defaults, not call-site
settings: `@nebutra/db` sets `statement_timeout` with `SET LOCAL` inside
`getTenantDb`, which covers only queries that go through `getTenantDb`. A raw
client or a future code path that forgets inherits nothing. Role defaults apply
to every session the role opens.

| Setting | Value | What it prevents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `statement_timeout` | 30s | A runaway query bills CPU for as long as it runs |
| `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` | 60s | The expensive one — a client that opens a transaction and stops blocks autovacuum database-wide, so storage grows and never comes back, while pinning one of the origin's 15 connections |
| `lock_timeout` | 10s | Fail one query instead of queueing every session behind a held lock |
| `idle_session_timeout` | 15min | A silent connection still occupies a slot |
| `CONNECTION LIMIT` | 50 | A leaking loop cannot take every slot the plan allows |

Verified on PostgreSQL 17.8: a 35s query on a raw connection that never touched
`getTenantDb` is cancelled at 30s, and a transaction left idle is terminated by
the server.

Storage is handled separately by `retention.sql` — eight append-only tables
with windows from 7 days (expired sessions) to 400 days (billing evidence),
purged nightly by a Cron Trigger on the gateway Worker.

Audit with `scripts/db-cost-audit.sh "<admin url>"`: size, bloat, sessions idle
in a transaction, connection use, and tables with no retention policy.

### Only in the PlanetScale console

- **Cluster size.** Compute is the fixed part of the bill. Resizing is the only
  way it changes, so it cannot run away on its own — but it also will not
  autoscale down.
- **Branch count.** Every branch is a running cluster. Delete dev branches when
  finished; this is the most common surprise line item.
- **Backup retention.** Longer retention is more stored bytes.

## Upstash

### What actually bills

Commands, not gigabytes. `maxmemory` is 3 GB and enforced by the provider, so
memory cannot run away — `total_commands_processed` is the meter. PING, INFO
and the other operational commands are not charged, so health checks are free;
everything on the request path is not.

### Commands per request, and what was removed

| Where | Commands | Since |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Edge Worker, every `api.nebutra.com` request | ~~INCR+EXPIRE = 2~~ → **0** | 2026-09-02: the per-IP flood limit is Cloudflare's rate limiting binding (`[[ratelimits]]` in `wrangler.edge.toml`), not metered, no Redis credentials at the edge |
| Origin, authenticated `/api/v1/*` | ~~rate limit GET+SET = 2, metering INCR+EXPIRE = 2~~ → **2** | 2026-09-02: the token bucket is one atomic EVAL (`packages/platform/rate-limit`), and metering sets EXPIRE only on the increment that creates the month key |
| Origin, each AI completion | +5 (api-key, balance ×2, pricing, spend EVAL) + 1 DEL, +2 EVAL per circuit-breaker call, +1 QStash message | `packages/platform/gateway-core` |

Upstash documents that PING and INFO are free and that every other command is
counted, but not how EVAL is metered. Read `total_commands_processed` before
and after a deploy that changes the script paths rather than assuming.

The edge line was the expensive one: it ran for scanners and bots as much as
for customers, and each call was also a round trip to Redis's region before
the origin fetch could start. The binding counts per Cloudflare location and
is eventually consistent, which is the right shape for shedding floods; the
per-key limit that protects tenants stays at the origin.

Audit with:

```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=… UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=… scripts/redis-cost-audit.sh
```

It reports memory against the cap, eviction and expiry counts, hit rate,
command volume, and — sampled directly rather than inferred from `INFO`, which
lags behind deletes — which keys carry no TTL.

A key written without an expiry is permanent: nothing reclaims it, and nothing
reports it. Every live write path in this codebase sets one today (idempotency
locks, rate-limit buckets, every cache strategy); the audit exists to catch the
one that eventually does not.

### Only in the Upstash console

- **Max monthly budget.** The hard ceiling. Nothing in this repo can enforce a
  spend cap; set it on the database's billing settings.
- **IP allowlist: leave it empty.** Cloudflare Workers egress from a large,
  changing set of addresses, so an allowlist cannot be made to fit them — with
  one configured, the gateway cannot reach Redis at all. Restrict access with a
  read-only token instead if it is needed.

### One thing that is not a cost setting

The eviction policy is `optimistic-volatile`, which evicts keys that have a
TTL. That is correct for cache. But idempotency locks and rate-limit buckets
also carry TTLs, so under real memory pressure they can be evicted too — and
that surfaces as duplicate work or a missed limit, not as an error. Memory
headroom is a correctness property here, not only a cost one. Treat sustained
`evicted_keys` growth as a bug, not as the cache doing its job.

## Vercel

Vercel meters build minutes. One Git repo linked to several projects opens a
remote build per project per push, and a workflow that runs `vercel deploy` on
the same commit opens a second one. Production web/auth is not Vercel — those
projects must not auto-deploy (`git.deploymentEnabled: false`). `nebutra.com`
is Vercel, but its build runs on GitHub's free runners and only the prebuilt
output is uploaded, so it meters nothing; its Git integration is off for the
same reason. `nebutra-kuanlan` stays Git-linked; the ignore script skips until
`apps/kuanlan/package.json` exists. Playbook: [vercel-spend.md](./vercel-spend.md).

## Settings only a dashboard can see

Every guardrail above that says "only in the console" shares a failure mode:
nothing in git knows the setting, so nothing notices when it changes. A build
machine gets promoted by the provider's own heuristics; a variable gets flagged
Sensitive by a click; a secret survives a copy from an old host; a token is
re-issued with one scope fewer. Each of those was found by the bill or by a
failed deploy, never by a check.

`scripts/ops/platform-reconcile.mjs` closes that gap without writing anything.
A JSON file per brand — `ops/<brand>/platform-expected.json`, schema in
[`ops/README.md`](../../ops/README.md) — declares the settings that matter, and
the engine asks each provider what it currently holds:

| Provider | Declared | Read from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel | build machine type, project-level Ignored Build Step, whether a Git link exists, env keys that must not be Sensitive on a target | `GET /v9/projects/{name}`, `GET /v10/projects/{name}/env` |
| Fly | secret names that must exist, secret names that must not | `flyctl secrets list --json` |
| GitHub | repository variable values (deploy target selectors) | the workflow's own `vars` context, or `gh variable get` |
| Cloudflare | a named Worker binding, optionally its type | `GET /workers/scripts/{name}/settings` |

One row per expectation, four states: `ok`, `drift`, `skipped` (no token, tool
missing, token lacks the scope), `error` (asked, no usable answer). Drift and
error exit 1. Skipped exits 0 locally and 1 under `--strict`, which is how the
scheduled run [`platform-reconcile.yml`](../../.github/workflows/platform-reconcile.yml)
invokes it — so a repository secret that disappears fails the run instead of
quietly shrinking what is checked. A failed scheduled run is the alert; GitHub
notifies the author of the last commit that touched the workflow's cron line
(not the repository owner), and the job summary carries the table.

The engine prints names and types, never values: Fly digests are dropped on
parse, the `value` field of a Vercel env entry is never read, and GitHub
variables are non-secret configuration by definition. Fixing drift stays a
human decision in the dashboard or the CLI; the check only says where.

To add a guardrail, add a line to the declaration. The scaffold ships the same
schema as `infra/ops/platform-expected.example.json`.

## Still open: AI token spend

The balance guard in `packages/platform/gateway-core/src/auth/balance-guard.ts`
checks `balance > 0` against a 30-second Redis cache. Two gaps:

1. **Concurrency.** Within that 30s window every concurrent request reads the
   same cached positive balance and is admitted. At high concurrency a tenant
   spends well past zero before the cache expires.
2. **No per-request ceiling.** A balance of one cent admits a request that can
   cost fifty dollars — nothing bounds `max_tokens` or context size.

Closing (1) properly needs an atomic reserve-then-settle, which the current
Redis interface cannot express: it exposes `get`/`set`/`del` with no
`INCRBY`/`DECRBY`. Closing (2) is cheaper and independent — a hard ceiling on
`max_tokens` and request size bounds the worst case per request without
touching normal traffic.

Neither is done.
