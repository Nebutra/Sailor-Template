# Configure npm trusted publishing (OIDC) for every scoped package.
#
# Run it in a terminal:
#   bash scripts/ops/setup-npm-trusted-publishing.sh
#
# npm requires 2FA for this (it is an account-settings change, so even reads
# need it). In a terminal it prints an npmjs URL and WAITS for you to approve,
# then reuses that elevated session for the rest of the run.
#
# That wait only happens when npm can see a TTY on stdout. An earlier version of
# this script captured output with `output=$(npm trust ... 2>&1)`, which put a
# pipe there — so npm skipped the browser flow and failed with EOTP instantly,
# in a real terminal, and the script looked like it was the terminal's fault.
# Do not reintroduce command substitution around these calls.
#
# Without a TTY (agent session, CI), pass a code instead:
#   NPM_OTP=123456 bash scripts/ops/setup-npm-trusted-publishing.sh
#
# The unscoped CLIs (create-sailor, nebutra) already publish via OIDC and are
# not listed here.
#
# Only after every package succeeds:
#   gh variable set NPM_TRUSTED_PUBLISHING --body true
#
# Flipping that variable first breaks the next release outright:
# scripts/release-publish.sh unsets the token on the trusted-publishing path,
# so any package without trust configured fails to publish.
