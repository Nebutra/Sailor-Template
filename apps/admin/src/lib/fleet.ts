/**
 * Fleet inventory — the ecosystem as configuration.
 *
 * Phase 1 of the control plane renders CONFIGURATION STATE, not observed state:
 * which app is supposed to be on which host, runtime, and port. Nothing here is
 * probed. A health column that reports green because no request was made is
 * worse than no column at all, so live probing is a Phase 2 gate — see
 * docs/plans/2026-07-28-nebutra-admin-control-plane-design.md §5.1.
 *
 * The hostnames come from `brand.domains` (rebrand-safe) and the deploy targets
 * from `@nebutra/preset/deploy-target`. The PM2 process names and ports are
 * mirrored from `infra/iac/ecs/ecosystem.config.cjs`; `__tests__/fleet.test.ts`
 * fails if that file and this list drift apart.
