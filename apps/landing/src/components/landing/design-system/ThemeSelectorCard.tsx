/**
 * The design-language switch, live, on the page it is a claim about.
 *
 * What stood here was a drawing of one: four swatches carrying `cursor-pointer`
 * and no handler, a code sample declaring a `themes` object this product does
 * not have, and a dashboard painted green by hand. A section whose headline is
 * about a design system, illustrated with a picture of a design system.
 *
 * The mechanism was real the whole time — `html[data-brand]` plus skins.css,
 * eight Brand Packages, already shipping. So the card runs it. Pressing Linear
 * here does not restyle this card; it restyles the entire page, because that is
 * what a Brand Package does, and a visitor watching the hero, the pricing table
 * and the footer change under one press has been told something no mockup can
 * tell them.
 *
 * The specimen below the buttons is deliberately made of the same tokens the
 * rest of the site is made of, with nothing hand-coloured: if a surface here
 * fails to move, that is a real gap in the language and should be visible.
