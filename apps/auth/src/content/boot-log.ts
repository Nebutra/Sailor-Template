/**
 * Boot log — the rotating archive entry on the auth-center left panel.
 *
 * Editorial contract (read before adding an entry):
 *   1. Verifiable, not remembered. `sources` is a required field precisely so
 *      that an entry cannot be added from memory. Every date, figure and
 *      attribution below was checked against the cited pages. Where the popular
 *      version of a story is wrong — Mariner 1's "hyphen", Hopper's moth, the
 *      "rsync" in the Dropbox comment — the entry states the checked version
 *      and lets the myth be the twist.
 *   2. It must turn. The last third of the body contradicts what the first two
 *      thirds set up: a rejected paper that became a law, a demo nobody acted
 *      on, a fix so complete that people denied the problem had been real.
 *   3. The coda states an outcome, never a lesson. It is the flat line after
 *      the turn, not a moral. If it could end in an exclamation mark it is the
 *      wrong sentence — see the seven prohibitions in
 *      docs/microcopy/nebutra-microcopy-system.md.
 *   4. Body ≈ 90–140 CJK characters. The card reserves a fixed height so the
 *      rotation never shifts the panel; longer entries defeat that.
 *
 * Sources are maintainer-facing and deliberately not rendered — the panel sits
 * beside a login form, and an outbound link there is an exit, not a feature.
 *
 * Copy lives here rather than in packages/platform/i18n/locales/*.json on
 * purpose: those 35 catalogs are gated for key parity, and this is editorial
 * prose that would need re-translating by hand on every edit. Two languages are
 * authored; every other locale reads the English.
